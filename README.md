# botcalc-pro

A desktop helper for picking motors/ESCs/batteries from vendor specs. It derives performance, safety (heat & wire gauge), and compatibility (voltage/current/type/ERPM).

## How we work
- Every change comes from an Issue.
- Work happens on a branch named after the Issue.
- Open a Pull Request (PR); merge only when checks are green.

## Getting started (local)
- Install Node LTS.
- Clone: `git clone https://github.com/<you>/botcalc-pro.git`
- (Code scaffolding will be added in Milestone 1.)

CI: TypeScript + Vitest are configured.
